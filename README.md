# COVID19-Twitter-Analysis
Using the Python programming language, we were able to research and analyze the Twitter dataset to figure out the effects COVID-19 has had globally. Our goal is to dive deep into the use of coronavirus related hashtags, including their frequency of use, and to analyze the impact of positive, negative, sentimental and neutral tweets on social media regarding COVID-19. We will also view the activity level of COVID-19 related tweets from the verified accounts on social media since they have the ability to utilize their platform to spread awareness of social distancing and ‘stay-at-home’ measures. Utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methodologies with our research will help to guide further in-depth exploration of how to take advantage of recent advancements.
